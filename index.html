In addition to performing concerts, we use music as a tool of social transformation. For this reason, I invited my friends to visit the University Hospital, to bring music, bananos and smiles to everyone, especially to the Oncological Unit. This hospital needs help, due to the humanitarian crisis suffered by Venezuela. I’d like to buy medical supplies to help patients and the hospital. I’ll also turn this project into something permanent, I count on the support of my musician friends who believe in this as much as I do.</p>

          <p ALIGN="justify"> The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and the lack of food means that many parents with families do not have the necessary resources to support themselves, therefore; My project is as follows: my family and I inherited more than 100 hectares of land from my grandparents, we can plant corn and grains. Venezuela is the largest consumer of corn in Latin America, offers work and food to many people who will participate in the plantations, donations of food to families in critical condition and corn, grains, etc. at very low prices for the communities, recovering the investments that were made.</p>

          <p ALIGN="justify">My idea is to plant different types of vegetables and fruits on the other hand raise egg-laying hens. This land is unused and to be honest with the situation as this would be both a means of production and a humanitarian aid because in my country food is so expensive that we could in the future supply fruit shops and sell eggs at a lower value thus helping others to obtain such food as well as eventualities such as '' sopazos '' that are sponsored by the Banana Coin currency through this project</p>
